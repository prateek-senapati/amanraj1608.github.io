            My name is Aman Raj, I am an Anime lover who pass his most time watching Anime. <br><br><br>
            I used to live in New Delhi with my parents till high school. After completing my schools I cleared JEE
            Mains and got
            30K rank in 1.3M students. I joined in Computer Science at Indian Institute of Information Technology
            Vadodara.. <br><br>
            My coding journey started on August 16, 2018 when I wrote my first program of "Hello World!" in C language.
            It took me some time to get realise how big this coding world is and how easily you can get confused here.
            In starting I thought
            this is to much for me but later i started enjoying things. I completed my first semester and learned C.
            <br><br>
            In holidays I learned C++ and I just fall in love with it. I can say my favourite language is C++. I started
            solving
            competetive programming questions in C++. Then in semester 2 while in college they were teaching Data Structure I
            started learning JavaScript alongside
            and here here I am writting this post here. <br>
